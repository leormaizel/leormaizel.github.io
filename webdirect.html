			<h2 class="item-title">Background</h2>
			<p>During the winter of 2015, BookingSuite built WebDirect&mdash;a turnkey content management system for
				hotels. Leveraging data and assets from Booking.com’s e-commerce website, hoteliers could have a fully
				functioning website, complete with pre-populated photography, and a series of pre-built, canonical pages
				(Home, Rooms, Facilities, Photos, Reservations). All for free. Within months, BookingSuite’s install
				base grew by 10x.</p>
			<p>This product was geared toward the “long tail” market segment, but for more sophisticated hotels with
				more complex digital marketing needs, BookingSuite sought to build a more premium product
				offering&mdash;WebDirect+.</p>
			<p>The main goal was to take the existing product, built for automation and scale, and supplement it with
				more premium features allowing for greater customization and expression of a hotel's unique character.
				Some of these features included a WYSIWYG page builder, a site navigation and IA editor, and new
				canonical pages such as Dining and Attractions, etc.</p>

			<h2 class="item-title">Page Builder</h2>
			<p>The segment we targeted for WebDirect+ needs to be able to create custom pages, whether for a promotion,
				an article about the history of the hotel, etc. The goal was to design a full-featured WYSIWYG editor,
				but as I found in my user tests, even the best of such products&mdash;Squarespace, Wix, and
				Weebly&mdash;are often described as “finicky” and "hard to use." I needed to find the right balance
				between robust functionality and UI limitations.</p>

			<h2 class="item-title">Page Manager</h2>
			<p>Like any CMS, the user needs to be able to manage the navigational structure and IA of their site. Some
				considerations/requirements included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adding, deleting, or duplicating a page</li>
				<li>Moving a page from the header to the footer, and vice versa</li>
				<li>Whether to treat system generated pages differently than user-generated pages</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I opted to test an interaction pattern that is highly popular amongst comparable CMS solutions: a model
				that is both a list of site pages, as well as menu builder.</p>

			<h2 class="item-title">Dining Page</h2>
			<p>The most common page users would create on their websites manually were showcases of a hotel’s dining
				options. Interestingly, these same customers often had already listed these dining facilities on
				Booking.com. In an effort to make the process of launching a website more streamlined, we added a
				system-generated “Dining” page to the list of canonical pages. When a website was initially provisioned,
				we'd read all the existing data of the dining facility on Booking.com and create a pre-filled page that
				the user could then enhance/edit.</p>
			<p>This project was especially challenging because some hotels provided very little and some a great deal of
				data about their dining options. The vast majority of hotels have one restaurant; fewer have 3 or more.
				I aimed to design a modular system that could accommodate the minimalist as well as fully robust use
				cases.</p>

			<h2 class="item-title">User Research</h2>
			<p>Throughout this process I cared out a series of remote user tests. Using clickable InVision prototypes, I
				observed and recorded users interacting with these features. Using UserTesting.com, I conducted a
				statistically-significant first-click analysis of how users expect to interact with the Page Manager
				feature. These tests provided invaluable feedback and validation for our MVP.</p>
