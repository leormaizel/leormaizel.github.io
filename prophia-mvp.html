            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Today, Prophia (FKA Leaseable) is a SaaS platform that enables Commercial Real Estate (CRE)
                firms to gain better insight into the performance of their portfolios.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I joined as employee #2, Prophia was nothing but a
                hypothesis: the inefficiency endemic to CRE represents an
                opportunity for technological innovation. But what form that might take was unknown.
            </p>
            <h2>Validating the Problem Space</h2>
            <p>
                Before we built anything, the founding team met with 12 CRE
                firms ranging from boutique to REITs and pre-sold a hypothetical product to see
                which value propositions garnered the most interest.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lease Management: making the day-to-day management of their tenants more efficient by automating manual processes </li>
                <li>Transactional Efficiency: enabling CRE firms to track deals,
                    negotiations, and collaborate as a team</li>
                <li>Data Insights: providing authoritative benchmarking and market comp data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As the sole/founding designer I put together conceptual designs that
                incorporated these 3 directions:
            </p>
            <iframe class="no-gallery" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450"
                src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FBJiX9DNtyGa3RmMfbUyv0R%2FFrank-Robinson%3Fnode-id%3D2%253A3%26scaling%3Dmin-zoom%26page-id%3D0%253A1"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>
                With findings from our interviews, we developed a working understanding of:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The organizational differences between CRE firms of different sizes</li>
                <li>The job roles within each firm type</li>
                <li>The buyers versus the platform users</li>
                <li>The opportunities untapped in the competitive landscape</li>
                <li>The inter-organizational complexity of our ideas. I.e. some solutions could deliver value to just the CRE firm, whereas
                    others required adoption lawyers, brokers,
                    and banks as well</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>MVP Strategy</h2>
            <p>
                We focused our MVP on addressing the following key business problems:
            </p>
            <h3>#1: Critical business data is inaccessible</h3>
            <p>
                There is no source of business data more critical than the lease document; it
                drives cash flows, budget projections, buying/selling strategy, etc. However,
                this critical asset is always either a physical document locked in a fireproof
                cabinet or a PDF in a jumbled share drive. The data is neither accessible,
                extensible, nor dynamic
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, leases are inherently complex; landlords must deploy massive resources
                to create standardized summaries of the key points of the lease to mitigate this
                complexity.
            </p>
            <h3>#2: No single source of truth</h3>
            <p>
                An entire solar
                system of brittle reporting revolves around the lease document; Excel reports are pockmarked with
                broken references; uncertainty reigns over which report is up-to-date;
                data is frequently inconsistent between vendor software systems like
                accounting, budgeting, etc.
            </p>
            <h3>#3: Endless low-level busywork</h3>
            <p>
                CRE firms have rigorous reporting obligations to stakeholders such as lenders,
                capital partners, limited partners, the SEC, etc. Analysts regularly
                generate reports cobbled together from disparate systems and
                legal documents &mdash;for every single building. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, the daily, bread-and-butter work of managing leases falls to the
                armies of lease administrators who must wade through complex
                legalese to determine the Landlord's obligations.
            </p>
            <h3>MVP Features</h3>
            <p>
                Given the problems we hoped to solve, the Chief Architect, CPO, and I
                brainstormed the key features of our MVP:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A digitized version of each lease contract, keyword
                    searchable, where the key provisions of the lease are marked and standardized</li>
                <li>A process that enables our internal team to capture each
                    data point in each document</li>
                <li>A standardized and accessible “lease summary” in which the most critical
                    data is summarized</li>
                <li>A searchable database of tenants</li>
                <li>Canned industry-standard reports based on this data</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>
                I’d never designed anything from scratch before; in every previous role, the
                universe of possibilities had already been collapsed into an existing
                IA/UI. But Prophia had zero constraints&mdash;an
                experience simultaneously nerve-wracking and liberating.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several of my key considerations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What are the key pieces of content and their differentiators? Is this content hierarchical in nature, or flat?</li>
                <li>What are the key anticipated user paths throughout this content?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I sought to follow closely the paradigms that I observed were
                familiar to those in CRE, knowing that none of my designs would fully
                stand the test of time and that future designers would invariably curse my name.

                <p>
                    Prophia is an enterprise-level SaaS product; It isn’t cheap, it can’t be used
                    instantly upon sign-up, and it involves long sales
                    cycles. The Prophia MVP could not have succeeded without our
                    Design Partners&mdash;8 CRE firms of different sizes. I
                    ran (and continue to run) this program, geared toward:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gathering feedback on features in design and on our roadmap</li>
                    <li>Shadowing team members to better understand workflows/processes</li>
                    <li>Access to sample critical business reports and documents</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The Prophia MVP was released on September 18th, 2018. My ongoing research and
                    validation work with Design Partners continues to inform our product
                    prioritization, and we’ve seen <span class="emphasis">steady quarterly growth</span> in new
                    customers and expansions ever since.
