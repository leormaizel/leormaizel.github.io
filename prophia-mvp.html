            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Prophia (FKA Leaseable) is a platform that enables commercial real estate (CRE)
                firms to aggregate, manage, and leverage unstructured private building data to
                drive better asset and portfolio performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I joined as employee #2, none of this was true&mdash;yet. The founders had only
                a hypothesis: the inefficiency inherent in CRE processes represents an
                opportunity for technological innovation. But what form should that take?
            </p>
            <h2>Validating the Problem Space</h2>
            <p>
                Before we built anything, our founding team met with 12 CRE executives from
                firms ranging from boutique to REITs and pre-sold a hypothetical product to see
                which value propositions garnered the most interest
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lease Management: giving CRE firms better insight into the contents of their
                    lease portfolios</li>
                <li>Transactional Efficiency: enabling CRE firms to track deals, lease
                    negotiations, and collaborate as a team</li>
                <li>Data Insights: providing authoritative benchmarking/market comp data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As the sole/founding designer I put together a conceptual design that
                incorporated these 3 potential directions:
            </p>
            <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450"
                src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FBJiX9DNtyGa3RmMfbUyv0R%2FFrank-Robinson%3Fnode-id%3D2%253A3%26scaling%3Dmin-zoom%26page-id%3D0%253A1"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>
                With the findings from our interviews, we developed a working understanding of:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The organizational differences between CRE firms of different sizes/AUM</li>
                <li>The different job roles within each firm type</li>
                <li>The decision-makers versus the potential platform users</li>
                <li>Which opportunities are untapped in the competitive landscape</li>
                <li>The inter-organizational complexity of different potential product</li>
                directions. I.e. some solutions can deliver value to just the CRE firm, whereas
                others require adoption by others in the ecosystem, such as Lawyers, Brokers,
                and Banks</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>MVP Strategy</h2>
            <p>
                We focused our MVP on addressing the following key business problems:
            </p>
            <h3>#1: Critical business data is inaccessible</h3>
            <p>
                There is no source of business data more critical than the lease document; it
                drives cash flows, budget projections, buying/selling strategy, etc. However,
                this critical asset is always either a physical document locked in a fireproof
                cabinet or a PDF in a jumbled share drive. The data is not accessible,
                extensible, or dynamic
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, leases are inherently complex; LLs must regularly employ resources
                to create standardized summaries of the key points of the lease to mitigate this
                complexity.
            </p>
            <h3>#2: No single source of truth</h3>
            <p>
                Since lease data is locked away in dumb, lifeless documents, an entire solar
                system of brittle reporting revolves around it; Excel reports are plagued with
                broken references; uncertainty reigns over which report is the most up-to-date;
                there are frequent data discrepancies between vendor software systems like
                accounting, cash-flow projection, etc., where o one can be sure of the correct
                figures without looking at the physical document.
            </p>
            <h3>#3: Endless low-level busywork</h3>
            <p>
                CRE firms have burdensome reporting obligations to stakeholders such as lenders,
                capital partners, limited partners, the SEC, etc. Analysts regularly need to
                generate critical reports cobbled together from numerous disparate systems, and
                from the legal documents themselves&mdash;for every single building the firm owns!
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, the daily, bread-and-butter work of managing leases falls to the
                armies of lease administrators whose job it is to dig through the complex
                legalese of these documents to determine legal obligations
            </p>
            <h3>MVP Features</h3>
            <p>
                Given the target problems we hoped to solve, the Chief Architect, CPO, and I
                brainstormed the key features of our MVP:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A digitized version of each lease contract, where the document is keyword
                    searchable, and where the key provisions of the lease are marked and summarized</li>
                <li>A process that enables our internal team to manually mark and annotate each
                    data point in each document</li>
                <li>A standardized, and accessible “lease summary” in which the most critical
                    data for each lease is summarized</li>
                <li>A searchable database of tenants</li>
                <li>Canned industry-standard reports based on this data</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>
                I’d never designed anything from scratch before; in every previous role, the
                universe of endless possibilities had already been collapsed into an existing
                IA/UI. But designing Prophia was an exercise in having zero constraints&mdash;an
                experience simultaneously nerve-wracking and liberating.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several of the key questions I considered were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What are the key pieces of content on the app? What are their primary
                    differentiators? Are they hierarchical in nature, or flat?</li>
                <li>What are the key anticipated user paths throughout this content?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I sought to follow as closely as possible what I observed were the paradigms
                familiar to people in CRE, knowing of course that none of my designs would fully
                stand the test of time and that future designers at Prophia would undoubtedly curse my name.

                <p>
                    Prophia is an enterprise-level SaaS product; It isn’t cheap, it can’t be used
                    instantly upon sign-up, and the decision to subscribe to it involves long sales
                    cycles. For these reasons, the Prophia MVP could not have succeeded without our
                    Design Partners&mdash;8 CRE firms of different sizes that gave us monthly feedback. I
                    ran (and continue to run) this program, geared toward:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gathering feedback on features in design & on our roadmap</li>
                    <li>Shadowing team members to better understand workflows/processes</li>
                    <li>Access to critical business reports for research purposes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The Prophia MVP was released on September 18th, 2018. My ongoing research and
                    validation work with Design Partners continues to inform our product
                    prioritization, and we’ve seen steady quarterly growth in new customers and
                    especially in expansions.
