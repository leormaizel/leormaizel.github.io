			<h2 class="item-title">Background</h2>
			<p>Codenamed “Project Uno,” this was the most complex, ambitious, and fascinating project I’ve ever had the
				pleasure of working on. Its aim was nothing less than the introduction a completely novel product in the
				hospitality software marketplace. To understand Uno, it’s important to know that the average hotel may
				manage up to 14 different vendor relationships. These most commonly include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Online travel agencies like Expedia and Booking.com</li>
				<li>Property Management software, for running the day-to-day operations of the hotel</li>
				<li>Channel Management software, for managing all the sites where a hotel publishes its rates</li>
				<li>Revenue Optimization software, for understanding how competitors price their rooms</li>
				<li>Billing and invoicing software</li>
				<li>And more...</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Uno aimed to bring all of these disparate elements into one package. It was a massive technical
				undertaking, and it relied on a fearsome number of dependencies, but no one else owned this space, and
				if successful, it could disrupt the industry completely.</p>

			<h2 class="item-title">Feature Design</h2>
			<p>My role in this project was to be a wearer of many different hats; when I started, a fair portion of the
				core navigational structure and feature set had been designed and spec’d, but many other features needed
				to be designed for web and the native iOS app.</p>

			<h2 class="item-title">IA Testing</h2>
			<p>Before investing too many resources in development, we wanted to validate our proposed IA structure. I
				helped carry out a series of statistically-significant reverse card-sort tests (AKA tree tests) with
				over 10,000 hotel partners in Italy, Spain, the UK, and the US. The goal of the test was scoped
				narrowly: to find the optimal IA for one portion on the application, but fascinatingly, the results had
				implications for the whole IA structure. We had nested pages too many levels deep for users to
				comfortably navigate.</p>

			<h2 class="item-title">Usability Testing</h2>
			<p>I also carried out a series of end-to-end, moderated usability sessions, in which I guided users through
				a list of scenarios and gathered feedback on feature improvements. The goals of these sessions were to
				gather general product feedback (would the user likely adopt this product?), measure task completion,
				and detect general usability issues.</p>

			<h2 class="item-title">A Dramatic Pivot</h2>
			<p>As Uno was in pilot phase with 8 hotels, the project took a dramatic turn. Booking.com already has a
				portal (the Extranet), where over 1 million hotel partners manage their room rates and availability.
				From the perspective of scale, it simply didn’t make sense to start from square one with customer
				acquisition, whereas, if we integrated our product with the existing Extranet, we would have an enormous
				and instantly addressable market. But our tech stack could not play nicely with Booking’s. We had to
				rebuild completely.</p>
			<p>Nor could our designs simply be ported into this new environment; the extranet utilizes different design
				patterns, has a different IA, and most importantly, Booking.com practices a radically different design
				philosophy to which I needed to adapt. Whereas we designed with the end-to-end experience in mind,
				prototyping and gathering qualitative user feedback on a wide array of feature sets, Booking.com favors
				small scale A/B testing, in which the most minute change must be defended with statistical significance.
				I needed to redesign all of the features of Uno in a phased approach; I’d design for the least amount of
				change, A/B test, and then proceed to the next phase.</p>

			<h2 class="item-title">Dashboard Case Study</h2>
			<p>The existing dashboard was extremely information dense; it showed guest arrivals and departures, recent
				booking.com reviews, new bookings, messages sent from the guest, etc. Right off the bat, the usability
				data we gathered for this page looked abysmal.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Users were extremely confused with the organization of content, as all items were combined in one
					messy jumble</li>
				<li>Users were not reliably able to find any specific piece of information, such as “when is this guest
					arriving?"</li>
				<li>Virtually nothing on the page was actionable; users could not take action on items without having to
					navigate elsewhere</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Taking this feedback into account, I designed a version of the dashboard which organized the data by
				category, and provided immediate next steps for each item. For some items, like arrivals and departures,
				chronology was of paramount importance; the hotelier needed to know which guests were arriving/departing
				first. For other items, like new guest reviews, chronology was trivial&mdash;it mattered less when the
				event occurred than simply notifying the hotelier that it occurred. For these reasons, I designed an
				approach that organized items by content type and tested it against the original design.</p>

		<div class="wrap">
			<p>The results of the test were immensely positive. My design increased next-step actions, such as users
				responding to guest messages by 325%. It also decreased inbound support requests, saving more than 700
				customer support hours per quarter. This design is now live for over 100,000 users, and over the next
				quarter will be released to all 1 million+ Booking.com partners.</p>

			<h2 class="item-title">Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The rebirth of the Uno product is set to reach pilot phase in November. It was an emotionally challenging
				experience to have to scrap and rebuild something in which I and the team had become so invested.
				However, the opportunity to design at such large scale, and with such a rigorous, scientific A/B test
				approach was enlightening. Designers from the Booking home office have reached out to learn about our
				product design philosophy and qualitative feedback-gathering methods. I’d like to think I’ve made a dent
				in their universe.</p>
