			<h3>There’s no denying that things have changed.</h3>
			<p>People have more access to technology than ever before. Devices with computing power unfathomable even 7
				years ago years ago now fit in our pocket. In our homes, our workplaces, and on our bodies, the
				internet, mobile applications, biometric technologies, voice control devices, and
				virtual/mixed/augmented realities are the substratum upon which we carry out our daily lives, conduct
				business and socialize with other human beings.</p>
			<p>As a result, core attitudes, assumptions, and routines that inextricably governed our lives are now
				irrevocably changed&#8212;the way we share information about ourselves is different. The way we expect
				to meet people is different. The way we expect to consume and retain information is different.</p>
			<p>This unprecedentedly rapid disruption has given way to a renaissance in the ways we interact with digital
				objects; the triumph of user centered design is in the dissemination of the idea that digital products
				and experiences should not only be of high performance and technical craftsmanship, but also something
				beyond the utilitarian&#8212;a little bit magical.</p>
			<p>But the pursuit of user centered design faces a dilemma.</p>
			<p>As designers, our role is to create digital products that add positive value in people’s lives. But what
				price have we paid?</p>
			<p>The more we create digital products that seek to enhance real physical experiences, the greater the risk
				that we begin to devalue the simple, core and real experiences that define what it is to be human.</p>
			<p>What are we, as a modern, technologically advanced society, sacrificing?</p>

			<p>We as designers have a responsibility. If we feel that that something real, vulnerable and inherently
				human is weakening, we can not excuse ourselves as passive agents. We design these products. We must
				address their consequences.</p>
			<p>Let us as an industry seek to design tools that help users carry out their daily tasks so they can get
				back to the business of human interaction. Let us always keep a watchful eye on whether our products
				encourage or discourage real social connections.</p>
			<p>And let us continually strive to find a happy medium.</p>
