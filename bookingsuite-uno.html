            <p>
                Hospitality software is a terribly disjointed ecosystem. All but the smallest
                hotels manage up to 14 different vendor relationships. These commonly include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Online travel agencies like Expedia and Booking.com</li>
                <li>Property Management software, for running the day-to-day operations of the
                    hotel</li>
                <li>Channel Management software, for coordinating its rates across sites</li>
                <li>Revenue Optimization software, for comp data on room pricing</li>
                <li>Billing and invoicing software</li>
                <li>Etc.</li>

                Having just been acquired by Booking.com, BookingSuite (FKA Buuteeq), was the
                former’s first foray into SaaS. Uno aimed to bring all of these disparate
                elements into one package. No player dominated this space, and if successful Uno
                could disrupt the entire industry.

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                When I started, the Lead PM and Design Director had largely defined the MVP feature specifications. My
                role was to tag-team along with the Design Director to flesh out the design and interaction,
                prototype and test these designs with hoteliers, and iterate and
                refine based on this feedback.

            <h2>Quantitative Testing</h2>
            <p>
                Before investing too many resources in development, we wanted to validate our
                proposed core IA structure. I helped carry out a series of statistically
                significant reverse card-sort tests (tree tests) with over 10,000 hotel partners
                in Italy, Spain, the UK, and the US. A major outcome of the test was the finding
                that we had nested pages too many levels deep for users to comfortably navigate.
            </p>
            <div class="gallery no-flexbox">

            </div>
            <h2>Qualitative Testing</h2>
            <p>
                I also carried out a series of eye-tracked, moderated usability sessions for our
                web and iOS apps. The goals of these sessions were to validate the problem
                space, gather general product/feature feedback, measure task completion, and
                detect general usability issues.
            </p>
            <h2>A Dramatic Pivot</h2>
            <p>
                As Uno was in pilot phase with 8 hotels, the project took a dramatic turn.
                Booking.com has a platform (the “Extranet”) on which over 20 million
                accommodation partners manage their room rates and availability. It didn’t make
                sense to start from square one with customer acquisition when we could have a
                massive and instantly addressable market if we integrated our product into the
                existing Extranet.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, our tech stack did not play nicely with the Extranet. Nor could our
                designs simply be ported into this new environment; the Extranet has different
                design patterns and a different core IA. Most importantly, Booking.com practices
                a radically different design philosophy.
            </p>
            <p>
                We needed to start again from scratch. To learn more about how I adapted to this
                new reality, and the organizational wins I was able to notch in my belt, check
