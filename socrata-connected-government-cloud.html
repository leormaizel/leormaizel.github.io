            <p>Steering a large ship in a new direction is a slow voyage
                with numerous squalls and unexpected icebergs. This is a story about organizational change and how design can help an organization

            <h3>Socrata Open Data
            </h3>
            <p>For over a decade, Socrata’s pioneering <a class="link"
                    href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?sortBy=most_accessed&utf8=%E2%9C%93">Open Data</a>
                software has enabled government agencies to publish their data publicly, fostering deeper citizen
                engagement. Agencies can take raw data from any system,
                and turn it into an engaging data “asset”, such as a tabular dataset, data visualization,
                written report, etc.

            <h3>Socrata’s Second Act: The Innovator’s Dilemma
            </h3>
            <p>As a mature product with many newer entrants to the space, Socrata began to see the commoditization of
                its product. To survive, it had to jump the <a class="link"
                    href="https://worldofwork.io/2019/07/the-innovators-dilemma/">innovation “s-curve”</a> and deliver
                new value to the market.
            </p>
            <div class="gallery">
                <div class="figure">
                    <div>
                        <a href="#" data-featherlight="assets/img/proj-scgc/s-curve.jpeg">

                    <p>The innovation "s-curve" models a product's lifecycle from initial disruption to maturity and eventual decline</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Through engagement with visionary customers, Socrata identified a larger opportunity; due to
                ubiquitous internal data silos, government workers often lack access to mission-critical data within
                their own agency, limiting their ability to make informed
                policy decisions. </p>
            <p>Socrata aimed to address this gap by tuning its core platform to
                work for the internal data-sharing use case.</p>
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>I worked primarily on two components of SCGC, each of which touched the entirety of the platform.
            </p>
            <h3>1: The Publishing Model
            </h3>
            <p>SCGC required a far more complex model for creating and publishing data than the existing
                platform provided. </p>
            <p>
                In the latter, small Open Data teams would collect datasets from within their
                agencies, inspect for accuracy, scrub PII, add necessary context, and then publish to the public.
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, SCGC represented an entire ecosystem of data creation, internal collaboration, and
                sharing.
                Users needed
                highly granular access controls. Version control&mdash;who can see the working draft,
                and
                who can only see the finalized version&mdash;was also essential. Finally, departments are protective of
                their
                data and reputation, any form of data-sharing required an approval workflow.
            </p>

            <h3>2: Unifying the UX</h3>
            <p>In SCGC, we were attempting to build a cohesive app, where users would feel empowered to do their daily
                analytical and collaborative work. </p>
                
                <p>However, until that point, the tables,
                visualizations, reports, maps, etc. that Socrata enabled users to produce were entirely white-label experiences,
                embedded within an agency’s site, and with minimal UI chrome of their own. There was little consistency in the way users
                would take critical actions upon each asset, like editing, sharing, and publishing.
            </p>
            <p>I felt strongly that our MVP would see its impact muffled without implementing some level of UX
                consistency. Advocating for this work during this tumultuous time
                for the organization was one of the most challenging experiences of my career, as I had to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Socialize my view within the wider product team
                </li>
                <li>Carve out time to research and design MVP-deliverable solutions
                </li>
                <li>Work with Engineering Managers and PMs to understand technical limitations
                </li>
                <li>Assuage stakeholders who felt left out of the decision-making process
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I found the best consensus-building weapon in my arsenal was to proactively and transparently
                share the findings from my research and usability testing.
            </p>
            <p>The result of all this kerfuffle was a rather small UI element. To unify the vastly different asset types, and to do so without a complete overhaul, required being as unobtrusive as
                possible. I designed an “actions bar” that floated at the top of the screen and provided a consistent
                home and
                jumping-off point for the collaboration and publishing features of SCGC.
            </p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>A mere month before MVP launch, Socrata was acquired by the Fortune 100 company Tyler Technologies. I
                learned that my designs were shown to the highest
                echelons of Tyler, and it was in part the promise of a <span class="emphasis">seamless and
                    consistent internal data-sharing experience</span> that made Tyler view Socrata as an
                acquisition dovetailing with their major <a class="link"

                Communities</a> line of business.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, SCGC is meaningfully increasing Average Recurring Revenue across Tyler's customers and is helping
                various business units expand aggressively. The publishing model and unifying UX I worked on are now the <span
