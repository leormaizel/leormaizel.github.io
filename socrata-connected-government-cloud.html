            <p>This is a story about organizational change and how design can help shepherd an organization

            <h3>Socrata Open Data
            </h3>
            <p>For over a decade, Socrata’s pioneering <a class="link"
                    href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?sortBy=most_accessed&utf8=%E2%9C%93">Open Data</a>
                software has enabled government agencies to publish their data publicly, putting them in compliance with
                transparency laws, and fostering deeper citizen engagement. Agencies can take raw data from any system,
                and make it consumable in the form of engaging data “assets”–tabular datasets, data visualizations,
                published reports, etc.
            </p>
            <div class="gallery">

            <h3>Socrata’s Second Act: The Innovator’s Dilemma
            </h3>
            <p>As a mature product with many newer entrants to the space, Socrata began to see the commoditization of
                its product. To survive, it had to jump the <a class="link"
                    href="https://worldofwork.io/2019/07/the-innovators-dilemma/">innovation “s-curve”</a> and deliver
                new value to the market.
            </p>
            <p>Through engagement with visionary customers, Socrata identified a much larger market opportunity; due to
                ubiquitous internal data silos, government workers often lack access to mission-critical data within
                their own agency. A data-starved agency is limited in its ability to make consensus- and data-driven
                policy decisions. Socrata aimed to address this gap by tuning its core public data-sharing platform to
                this internal data-sharing use case–Socrata Connected Government Cloud (SCGC).</p>
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>A large ship steering in a new direction (especially one serving government customers) is a slow voyage
                with numerous squalls and unexpected icebergs. I joined Socrata when the vision for SCGC was
                being internalized by the wider org, and the product team was translating this vision into concrete
                requirements.
            </p>
            <p>A basic outline of the MVP value SCGC would provide:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaboration: Often multiple subject-matter experts work together to produce a dataset
                    or report.</li>
                <li>Fine-grained access control: data might be sensitive. Users need control over which people/groups
                    can access it, be it one person, a team, the entire agency, or the public
                </li>
                <li>Authoritativeness: A clear demarcation is needed between data that is in progress&mdash;a sandbox
                    for
                    analysis&mdash;vs. data that is final and approved for wider dissemination.
                </li>

            <h3>Key Areas of Influence
            </h3>
            <p>I worked primarily on two components of SCGC. Each touched the entirety of the platform, and one I
                landed on entirely unexpectedly.
            </p>
            <h4>Challenge #1: The Publishing Model
            </h4>
            <p>SCGC required a far more complex model for creating and publishing data than Socrata’s existing Open Data
                platform. In the latter, small Open Data teams would collect datasets from within their
                agencies, inspect for accuracy, scrub PII, add necessary context, and then publish to the public.
            </p>
            <p>SCGC, however, represented an entire ecosystem of data creation, internal collaboration, and sharing.
                Users needed
                highly granular access controls. Version control&mdash;who can see the working draft,
                and
                who can only see the finalized version&mdash;was also essential. Finally, departments are protective of
                their
                data and reputation, any form of data-sharing required an approval workflow.
            </p>

            <p>Along with reams of existing research, I worked closely with 3 government agencies to validate my

                publishing, sharing, and collaboration designs:

            <h4>Challenge #2: Unifying the UX</h4>
            <p>Parallel to my work on the publishing model, I encountered a problem that if left unaddressed would
                have strongly negative impacts on the overall UX of SCGC.
            </p>
            <p>Users interact with Socrata primarily via the collection of data "assets" on Open Data sites: tables,
                visualizations, reports, maps, etc. Each are white-label experiences that embed within an agency’s site,
                having little information architecture and navigational structure of their own.
            </p>
            <p>In SCGC, we were attempting to build a cohesive app, where users would be enticed to do the
                bulk of their daily analytical and collaborative work. But there was little consistency in the way users
                would take critical actions upon each asset, like publishing and other CRUD operations.
            </p>
            <p>Imagine A Google Drive experience where sharing, inviting to collaborate, editing looked completely
                different
                in Docs vs. Sheets vs. Slides. Would this friction make users more or less likely to
                use Google Drive as their core productivity and collaboration suite?
            </p>
            <p>I felt strongly that our MVP would see its impact muffled without implementing some level of UX
                consistency. Advocating for this work while the project was in-flight and during this tumultuous time
                for the organization was (and remains) one of the most challenging experience of my career. The task
                ahead was to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Socialize my view within the wider product team
                </li>
                <li>Carve out time to research and design MVP-deliverable solutions
                </li>
                <li>Work with Engineering Managers and PMs to understand technical limitations and phase development
                </li>
                <li>Adequately communicate and assuage stakeholders who felt left out of the decision-making process
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I found the best consensus-building weapon in my arsenal was to proactively and transparently
                share the findings from my research and usability testing.
            </p>
            <p>Ironically, the result of all this was a rather small UI element. To unify each of the
                wildly different asset types, and to do so without a complete overhaul, required being as unobtrusive as
                possible. I designed an “actions bar” that floated at the top of the screen and provided a consistent
                home and
                jumping-off point for the collaboration and publishing features of SCGC.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>A mere month before MVP launch, Socrata was acquired by the Fortune 100 company Tyler Technologies. I
                learned that my designs were shown to the highest
                echelons of Tyler, and it was in part the promise of a <span class="emphasis">seamless and
                    consistent internal data-sharing experience</span> that made Tyler see Socrata as an
                acquisition that dovetails with their major investment in their <a class="link"
                    href="https://www.tylertech.com/about-us/tyler-client-difference/connected-communities">Connected

            </p>
            <p>
                Today, SCGC is meaningfully increasing Average Recurring Revenue across Tyler's customers and is helping
                various business units expand aggressively. The acquisition has so far proven to be highly beneficial
                for Tyler Tech. The publishing model and unifying UX I worked on are now the <span class="emphasis">standard platform experience.</span>
