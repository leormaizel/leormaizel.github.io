            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                For the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) firm, the most critical source of business data
                is the lease document; it drives budget projections,
                buying/selling strategies, etc. Unfortunately, leases tend to be physical documents
                locked in a
                fireproof cabinet, or PDFs lost in a jumbled share drive, leading to
                several downstream problems:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lease administrators must refer to the
                    lease document to answer all but the simplest questions.</li>
                <li>Key lease terms must be
                    manually entered into accounting systems, budgeting, etc.</li>
                <li>The more removed data gets from the source document the
                    higher the likelihood of discrepancies between systems.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Prophia solves these problems by extracting critical data
                straight from the source document, and presenting it in a standardized, dynamic, and
                extensible manner. And it does so at scale.

                But how did we get here?
            </p>
            <h2>Phase 1: Establishing a baseline manual process</h2>
            <p>
                Given limited MVP resources, we knew we'd have to start with a manual
                process for capturing the relevant data in each document. I designed an experience whereby
                our in-house team of
                “onboarders” could view the document, “tag” the critical data, and transform it into a standardized
                format.

            <h3>Ideation</h3>

                Not wanting to reinvent the wheel, I looked at similar existing

            </div>
            <p>When we released this functionality with the Prophia MVP, we achieved a critical business milestone&mdash;
                we had the functionality needed to onboard customer data. But it was painfully manual, as each set of lease documents took about 3.5 hours to onboard.
            </p>
            <h2>Phase 2: Scaling the process w/ Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>
                As we signed more beta customers, we approached a bottleneck in onboarding capabilities. As we hired more onboarders,
                we experimented with Machine Learning-based methods for
                interpreting and capturing textual information.</p>

                <p>Based on the promising initial results of these experiments, the product team collaboratively devised a 3-stage approach to operationalizing this
                technology:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Stage 1: The model lacks
                    sufficient training data to make accurate text predictions. However, it can alert the onboarder that a portion of text
                    appears “significant”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stage 2: Once we are sufficiently
                    confident in the model's recall and accuracy, predict which data points
                    are likely found within the text and present these predictions to the onboarder for verification.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stage 3: Automatically capture
                    data points where the model has demonstrated its predictive abilities with
                    sufficient accuracy
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I experimented with several concepts for how best to
                indicate where significant portions of text lie, and what they might contain:
            </p>
            <div class="gallery">
                <div class="figure">
                    <div>
                        <a href="#" data-featherlight="assets/img/proj-prophia-ml/docatlas-1.jpg">
                            <img src="assets/img/proj-prophia-ml/docatlas-1.jpg">
                        </a>
                    </div>
                    <p>Stage 1 concept: the model highlights a paragraph of significance</p>
                </div>
                <div class="figure">
                    <div>
                        <a href="#" data-featherlight="assets/img/proj-prophia-ml/docatlas-2.jpg">
                            <img src="assets/img/proj-prophia-ml/docatlas-2.jpg">
                        </a>
                    </div>
                    <p>A paragraph of significance may span multiple pages. This is a comparison between explicitly
                        highlighting the paragraph and merely pointing to it </p>
                </div>
                <div class="figure">
                    <div>
                        <a href="#" data-featherlight="assets/img/proj-prophia-ml/docatlas-3.jpg">
                            <img src="assets/img/proj-prophia-ml/docatlas-3.jpg">

                    </div>
                    <p>Stage 2 concept: the model is able to predict which data point/s lie in a paragraph</p>
                </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    After prototyping and testing these concepts with onboarders, findability was a clear area
                    of improvement. Many leases are hundreds of pages long;
                    suggestions are useless unless the onboarder knows that they exist and where to
                    find them. My solution involved a suggestions table of contents, and a custom
                    scrollbar indicating a suggestion's location.
                </p>

            <h3>Measuring Results</h3>
            <p>
                Measuring the performance of these features required overcoming several obstacles:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each new-hire onboarder experiences a learning
                    curve in interpreting lease documents</li>
                <li>The onboarding team continuously changes/improves their processes</li>
                <li>We regularly add to the number of data points we capture</li>

            <p>
                Despite these difficulties, our ML-aided data capture process has demonstrated clear value:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="emphasis">Half of all data points are captured 100% automatically</span>,
                        freeing our onboarders to focus on more complex lease terms</li>
                    <li>The text suggestion features I designed have decreased onboarding time by an average of <span
                        class="emphasis">64%</span>, from 3.5 to 1.25 hours per building.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This ML-powered ingress, extraction, and
                    interpretation pipeline is in no small part responsible for our success in
                   expanding with existing customers, handling large expansions in a timely manner, and <span class="emphasis">securing VC
                        investment.</span>
