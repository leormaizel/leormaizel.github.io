            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                For the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) firm, there is no source of business data
                more critical than the lease document; it drives cash flows, budget projections,
                buying/selling strategies, etc. Unfortunately, this data suffers from a
                debilitating flaw&mdash;it is always in the form of a physical document locked in a
                fireproof cabinet, or a PDF lost in a jumbled share drive, leading to
                several downstream problems:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Non-scalability: lease administrators must manually refer to the
                    document to answer all but the simplest questions.
                <li>Organizational inefficiency: since this data isn’t extensible, it must be
                    manually entered into all other 3rd-party systems (i.e. accounting, budgeting,
                    etc.).
                <li>Data discrepancies: the more removed data gets from the source document the
                    higher the likelihood of error.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Prophia platform solves these problems by extracting critical lease data
                straight from the source document, presenting it in a standardized, dynamic, and
                extensible manner, and it does so at scale.
            </p>

                But how did we get here?
            </p>
            <h2>Phase 1: Establishing a baseline manual process</h2>
            <p>
                For MVP, we knew we'd need to start off with a manual process; I needed to build an experience whereby
                our in-house team of
                “onboarders” could read the lease document, “tag” the critical data, categorize
                it, and transform it into the required format.
            </p>
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>
                Not wanting to reinvent the wheel, I looked at existing
                products that involve both the viewing of a document and the capture of
                important data within it:

                Once I felt reasonably confident, I tested prototypes of my proposed workflows with internal
                stakeholders, most importantly the team of onboarders. I refined my designs based on this feedback and
                delivered the spec for this critical feature.
            </p>
            <h2>Phase 2: Scaling the process w/ Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>
                As we signed up more beta customers, no path to scalability was possible without
                leveraging Machine Learning to interpret and extract the data. The whole product
                team worked collaboratively to assess the feasibility of various solutions, and
                how to operationalize them in the UX. Our approach was divided into 3 stages:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Stage 1: The model lacks
                    sufficient training data to make accurate predictions of the meaning of the
                    text. However, it is capable of alerting the onboarder that a portion of text
                    appears “significant”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stage 2: Once we are sufficiently
                    confident in the training data, build a model that predicts which data points
                    are likely to be found within a significant portion of text. Surface these
                    predictions to the onboarder for human verification.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stage 3: Automatically capture
                    data points where the model has demonstrated its predictive abilities with
                    sufficient accuracy
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I focused my efforts on stages 1 & 2 since we had greater confidence in our
                ability to deliver on them. I experimented with several concepts for how best to
                indicate where significant portions of text lie, and what they might contain:
            </p>
            <div class="gallery">
                <div class="figure">
                    <div>

                            <img src="assets/img/proj-prophia-ml/docatlas-1.jpg">
                        </a>
                    </div>
                    <p>Stage 1 concept: the model highlights a paragraph of significance</p>
                </div>
                <div class="figure">
                    <div>
                        <a href="#" data-featherlight="assets/img/proj-prophia-ml/docatlas-2.jpg">
                            <img src="assets/img/proj-prophia-ml/docatlas-2.jpg">
                        </a>
                    </div>
                    <p>A paragraph of significance may span multiple pages. This is a comparison between explicitly
                        highlighting the paragraph and merely pointing to it </p>
                </div>
                <div class="figure">
                    <div>

                    </div>
                    <p>Stage 2 concept: the model is able to predict which data point/s lie in a paragraph</p>
                </div>
                <div class="figure">
                    <div>

                        suggestions ToC, and a custom scrollbar with suggestion indicators</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                After prototyping and testing these concepts with our onboarders, a clear area
                of improvement was findability; many leases are hundreds of pages long and
                suggestions are useless unless the onboarder knows that they exist and where to
                find them. My solution involved a suggestions table of contents, and a custom
                scrollbar indicating the locations of each.
            </p>
            <h3>Measuring Results</h3>
            <p>
                As it turns out, measuring the performance of these features proved devilishly
                hard, because:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We’re constantly hiring new onboarders, each of which experiences a learning
                    curve with interpreting lease documents
                <li>The onboarding team is continuously updating and improving their processes
                <li>We regularly add to the number of data points we capture
                <li>Etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Despite this difficulty, a clear demonstration of value is the fact that we are now capturing <span
                    class="emphasis">more data points via ML</span> than have
                ever been captured by human onboarders. This ML-powered ingress, extraction, and
                interpretation pipeline is in no small part responsible for our success in
                expanding with existing customers, signing up new customers, and <span class="emphasis">securing VC
                    investment.</span>
