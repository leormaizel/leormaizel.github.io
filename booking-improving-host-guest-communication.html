            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                As described in the previous project, <a class="link" href="bookingsuite-uno">BookingSuite Uno</a>,
                the MVP of
                BookingSuite’s all-in-one hotel
                management product took a dramatic turn just as it had entered pilot.
                Booking.com (the parent company of BookingSuite) already had a platform (the
                “Extranet”) on which over 20 million accommodation partners manage their room
                rates and availability. It didn’t make sense to start from square one with
                customer acquisition on our own platform when we could have a massive and
                instantly addressable market if we integrated into the existing
                Extranet.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, our tech stack did not play nicely with the Extranet and our
                designs could not simply be ported over. We had to design and build
                anew.
            </p>
            <h2>Adapting to a New World</h2>
            <p>
                the Extranet had different design patterns and core IA. Most
                importantly, Booking.com practices a radically different design philosophy;
                whereas the team at BookingSuite was accustomed to large-scale
                green field products, Booking.com is organizationally devoted to small-scale A/B
                testing, where the most minute change must be defended with statistical
                significance. I needed to redesign of Uno in a phased
                approach; I’d design for the least amount of change, A/B test, and then proceed
                to the next feature.
            </p>
            <div class="gallery">
                <div class="figure">
                    <div>
                        <a href="#" data-featherlight="assets/img/proj-booking/old-home.jpg">

                        featureset, redesigning Uno would be quite the challenge.

            <h2>Redesigning the Dashboard: Research/Design Process</h2>
            <p>
                One of the goals of Uno was to enable the hotelier to see the most critical
                information about their hotel in a central, upfront location. This included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Messages from guests</li>
                <li>Estimated guest arrival times</li>
                <li>Check-ins/outs for the day</li>
                <li>Reservation notifications</li>
                <li>Etc.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                The Extranet’s hotelier dashboard had some
                of this functionality but lacked others critical to
                Uno’s value proposition. Before I added features to the dashboard, I wanted to
                gain a baseline of what was and wasn’t working well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I conducted remote usability tests with 14 different hotel partners in Europe,
                North, South, and Central America and was able to draw upon reams of research
                generated by Booking.com’s in-house researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data we gathered for this page was not encouraging:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>CSAT numbers for the Extranet were extremely poor</li>
                <li>The existing dashboard was far too information-dense; it showed guest
                    arrivals and departures, recent Booking.com reviews, new bookings, and messages
                    sent from the guest all together with no discernable content hierarchy or
                    separation</li>
                <li>As a result, users were not reliably able to find any specific piece of
                    information, such as when a guest might be arriving today. This had
                    disastrous outcomes such as a hoteliers missing a critical guest
                    message. One such instance was relayed with great embarrassment by the owner of
                    a hotel in Amsterdam: “it wasn’t just ‘Hi, can I have another pillow?’, it is
                    things like ‘I’m getting to the airport at 3 am, how can I get to your hotel?’
                    The guest felt abandoned.”</li>
                <li>Virtually nothing on the page was actionable without having to navigate
                    elsewhere</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Taking this feedback into account, I designed a version of the dashboard that
                organized the data by category and provided immediate next steps for each item.
                For some items, like arrivals and departures, chronology was of paramount
                importance; the hotelier needed to know which guests were arriving/departing
                first. For other items, like new guest reviews, chronology was trivial&mdash;it
                mattered less when the event occurred than that it
                occurred.

            <h2>Evaluation Process: A/B Testing</h2>
            <p>
                Normally, I'd want to
                prototype and test my designs for usability. However, the
                culture at Booking.com heavily favored A/B testing over more qualitative
                methods. As a new member of the Booking.com org, I
                didn’t feel I had the organizational clout to push the envelope quite yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The results of the test were overwhelmingly positive. My design increased
                next-step actions, such as hosts responding to guest messages by <span class="emphasis">391%</span>.
                By this metric, this experiment was in the <span class="emphasis">97th percentile</span> of all
                experiments tracked at Booking.com (keeping in mind that my
                changes were much larger in scope than normal). The redesigned dashboard decreased inbound support requests, saving more than <span class="emphasis">700</span>
                customer support hours per quarter.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                During my time at Booking.com, the experiment was turned “full-on” and released
                to approximately 1 million hotel partners around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Designers from the HQ office in Amsterdam took notice and even reached out to learn about our product design philosophy and
                qualitative feedback-gathering methods. I’d like to think I’ve made a small dent
                in their universe.
