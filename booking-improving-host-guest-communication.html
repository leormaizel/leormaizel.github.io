            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                As described in the previous project, <a class="link" href="bookingsuite-uno">BookingSuite Uno</a>,
                the MVP of
                BookingSuite’s all-in-one hotel
                management product took a dramatic turn just as it had entered pilot.
                Booking.com (the parent company of BookingSuite) already had a platform (the
                “Extranet”) on which 20 million+ accommodation partners manage their
                rates and availability. It didn’t make sense to release the product on a new platform with only  handful of users, when we could have a massive and
                instantly addressable market if we integrated into the
                Extranet.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, our tech stack did not play nicely with the Extranet and our
                designs could not simply be ported over. We had to re-design and re-build
                Uno from the ground up.
            </p>
            <h2>Adapting to a New World</h2>
            <p>
                The Extranet had vastly different design patterns and core IA. Most
                importantly, Booking.com practices a radically different design philosophy;
                whereas the team at BookingSuite was accustomed to large-scale
                greenfield products, Booking.com is organizationally committed to small-scale A/B
                testing, where the all changes must be defended with statistical
                significance.</p><p> I needed to redesign Uno in a phased
                approach; introduce the least amount of change, A/B test, and then proceed
                to the next feature.
            </p>
            <div class="gallery">
                <div class="figure">
                    <div>
                        <a href="#" data-featherlight="assets/img/proj-booking/old-home.jpg">
                            <img src="assets/img/proj-booking/old-home.jpg">
                        </a>
                    </div>
                    <p>A screen of the Booking.com hotelier extranet "Today" page. With a vastly different IA and
                        feature set, redesigning Uno would be quite the challenge.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>Redesigning the Dashboard: Research/Design Process</h2>
            <p>
                One of the goals of Uno was to enable the hotelier to see the most critical
                information about their hotel in a central, upfront location. This included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Messages from guests</li>
                <li>Estimated guest arrival times</li>
                <li>Check-ins/outs for the day</li>
                <li>Reservation notifications</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                The Extranet’s hotelier dashboard lacked much of this functionality. But before I added features to the dashboard, I wanted to
                gain a baseline of what was and wasn’t working well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I conducted remote usability tests with 7 different hotel partners in Europe,
                North, South, and Central America and was able to draw upon reams of research
                generated by Booking.com’s in-house researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data we gathered for this page was not encouraging:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The existing dashboard was far too information-dense; it showed guest
                    arrivals and departures, recent Booking.com reviews, new bookings, and guest messages
                    jumbled together with no discernible content hierarchy or
                    separation</li>
                <li>As a result, users were not reliably able to find any specific piece of
                    information, such as when a guest might be arriving. One such instance was relayed with great embarrassment by an Amsterdam hotelier: “it wasn’t just ‘Hi, can I have another pillow?’, it was
                     ‘I’m getting to the airport at 3 am, how can I get to your hotel?’
                    The guest was abandoned.”</li>
                <li>Virtually nothing on the page was actionable without having to navigate
                    elsewhere</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Taking this feedback into account, I designed a version of the dashboard that
                organized the data by category and provided immediate next steps for each item.

            <h2>Evaluation Process: A/B Testing</h2>
            <p>
                Normally, I'd want to
                prototype and test my designs for usability before development. However, the
                culture at Booking.com heavily favored A/B testing over more qualitative
                methods. As a new member of the Booking.com org, I
                didn’t feel I had the organizational clout to push the envelope quite yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The results of the test were overwhelmingly positive. My design increased
                next-step actions, such as hosts responding to guest messages by <span class="emphasis">431%</span>. The redesigned dashboard decreased inbound support requests, saving more than <span class="emphasis">700</span>
                customer support hours per quarter.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                During my time at Booking.com, the experiment was turned “full-on” and released
                to approximately 1 million hotel partners around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Designers from the HQ office in Amsterdam took notice and even reached out to learn about our product design philosophy and
                qualitative feedback-gathering methods. I’d like to think I’ve made a small dent
                in their universe.
