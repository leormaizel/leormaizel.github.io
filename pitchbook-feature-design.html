			<p>PitchBook is the most comprehensive database of Private Equity and Venture data on the market.
				Subscribers can slice-and-dice data on our analytics platform to research deals, company performance,
				fund performance, and make informed investment decisions. Throughout my time at PitchBook, I worked on
				various platform features and data visualizations, below you'll find a snapshot of some of my favorites.

			<h2 class="item-title">Company Timeline</h2>
			<p>One of the more interesting features I worked on at PitchBook was the company timeline visualization. The
				platform currently has data on over 700,000 private companies. Every company has a story&emdash;when it
				was founded, the rounds of financing it went through, when it was acquired, went public, or
				failed&emdash;but these stories were buried in our data. The user was not able to grasp quickly the most
				vital information about the companies she was researching.</p>
			<p>We wanted to find a more engaging visual method for presenting a company's timeline. I tired a variety of
				approaches, including the well-understood bar graph, with the X-axis representing the progression of
				time, and the Y-axis the magnitude of the transaction. But I also wanted to try an approach that
				expressed the concept of a timeline in a more approachable manner. Every person has a history, a
				timeline. The most common way we record and access this timeline is through photos. I sought to
				replicate the experience of flipping through photos via the recognizable cover flow pattern Apple
				pioneered.</p>

			<h2 class="item-title">Excel Plugin</h2>
			<p>Through competitive research and consistent feedback from users, we discovered that our web application
				was imposing an unnecessary constraint on our “power users”&#8212;the financial analysts at PE and VC
				firms who spend their entire day in Microsoft Excel and don’t want to learn another 3rd party platform.
				Thus the Pitch Book Plugin for Excel was born.</p>
			<p>The main goal of this project was to identify the core use cases in which an analyst would want to access
				Pitch Book data within Excel. We further wanted to identify whether there were any functionalities
				unique to the platform that we could incorporate into Excel.</p>
			<p>I interviewed several financial analysts, clients, as well as PitchBook’s financial research team, asking
				questions such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How do you use excel to conduct financial analysis?</li>
				<li>When you download data from our or other platforms into Excel, how do you typically manipulate it?
				</li>
				<li>What do you like/dislike about our competitors’ Excel plugins?</li>
				<li>What are the best practices for formatting data when modeling in Excel?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I determined that there were 3 key components that needed to be built into the plugin: the ability to
				access and manipulate standard industry modeling templates (representing the most common use case for
				the plugin), the ability to create custom formulas (for our “super power" users.), and the ability to
				access data queries saved and performed on the PitchBook web application.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For the widest use case&#8212;industry templates&#8212;I based the visual design on best practices
					for representing which cells are user inputs, which are pulled from our database, and which are base
					assumptions that underlie the entire template.</p>
				<p>Further responsibilities included writing all of the Excel error, alert & confirmation notifications,
					as well as creating a user guide with installation steps, overview of plugin functionality, and
					error troubleshooting.</p>
